Doubts over insect-bite treatment

People should consider using a cold, wet cloth to treat insect bites instead of turning to over-the-counter remedies, experts say. Prof Michael Siva-Jothy, from Sheffield University's Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, recruited twenty-nine brave volunteers to test the theory further, watching the bedbugs as they found a place to feed and removing them only as they were about to bite.

An investigation has concluded that there is little evidence that creams, painkillers and anti-inflammatories often used for bites actually work. In any case, said Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin researchers, the reactions got better by themselves in most cases. Midges, mosquitoes, flies, fleas and bed-bugs account for most bites. A variety of remedies are sold over the counter in pharmacies to relieve the itching, pain and swelling. Other scientists have suggested that swapping thicker fur for clothes was a way of making insect bites and parasitic infestations less likely. Prof Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading, said that biting parasites remain a major cause of disease and death worldwide, making them a potentially enormous evolutionary pressure on early man.
